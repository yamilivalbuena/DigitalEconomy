# Digital Economy

The following report contains topics related to Digital Economy that can help have a clearer image of the current situation and current issues that our society has been facing for the past few years. 
## UNIT II
*The characteristics of big data and cloud computing.*

Big data refers to large amounts of data generated by digital devices. It can be described with the following characteristics better known as the Vâ€™s of big data: volume, velocity, variety, variability, value, veracity, validity, vulnerability, volatility, and visualization. Some may recognize only a few of these concepts. Cloud computing aims to deliver a vast range of services such as servers, storage, networking, software, and analytics, that can offer flexibility, robustness, parallel computing, and scalability. The level of cloud computing integration varies when comparing different types of architectures (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) [1].

*What is Blockchain?*

A blockchain can be thought as a distributed database of records or a public ledger (a book or other collection of financial accounts of a particular type) of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. In this way, the verification of each transaction in the public ledger is achieved by consensus of a majority of the individuals in the system. An important characteristic of this technology is that information can never be erased [2]. 

*What is Hyperledger?*

As described at the official site of Hyperledger Foundation, Hyperledger is an open source community focused on developing a suite of stable frameworks, tools, and libraries for enterprise-grade blockchain deployments. It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation [3]. 

*Financial transactions*

Financial transactions imply any organization of action from which a party expects getting or exchanging money or any other thing of value including, but not constrained to, arrangements for purchase, deal, rent or other exchange of interest, such as construction or improvement of any facility or property, and procurement of services, both individual and counseling [4]. 

*Digital currencies*

There exist three types of digital currency: crypto currency, central bank digital currency and stablecoin. Cryptocurrency attempts to create decentralized currency, but it is characterized by high volatility, limited acceptance, and interoperability (Bitcoin, Ether); Central Bank Digital Currency is a new form of money issued by central banks directly to its citizens (eCNY in China, e-Krona in Sweden); Stablecoins are developed to mitigate the volatility and limited use of crypto and are issued by private entitiesand can be backed by assets [5].    

*Technical obstacles and political challenges (like bitcoin in El Salvador country)*

In a report published this year by the PricewaterhouseCoopers (a network-firm company located in London)  the authors remark the consequences of El Salvador adopting bitcoin as an official currency of the country. They mentioned that International Monetary Fund (IMF)  warned El Salvador against digital currency plans to use Bitcoin as national currency, that the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial, and legal issues that require very careful analysis. That the law requires clarifying the role of the public and private sectors in providing and regulating digital forms of money. The IMF focuses on any internal economic impacts related to domestic prices that could become highly unstable [6].

## UNIT III

*Describe the public acceptance of the technology*

There exist many indicators of public acceptance as well as the adaptation to innovations, but certainly, there are various contextual elements inherent to the problems that need to be considered before carrying out a comprehensive study on this matter. Nevertheless, it is unquestionable the fact that developed countries have a higher chance of benefitting from this analysis, compared to undeveloped countries as stated in the paper  Socio-psychological determinants of public acceptance of technologies [7]. 

*Identify skills for the use of ICT in work and life*

Some of the most valuable skills for students in the ICT field (and many other fields) are recognizing, spotting, and evaluating information as well as making effective use of it; for we live now in a digitalized world in which information is key to success. Similarly, knowing how to collect this information and being able to communicate results and findings with others is essential. The usage of e-libraries and discussion forums (often presented on social media environments) should be promoted as another way of promoting the right use of information. Speaking from a more objective perspective, some of the challenges of acquiring ICT skills include lack of funding, failure of the curriculum to include ICT related skills, poor attitudes toward acquiring new skills, unavailability of training opportunities,  poor ICT facilities, and lack of interest in digital information [8].

*Describe the existing regulation in Employment, Ethics, politics, and the data science related regulation*
As described in the book The Digital Economy by Tapscott, every business needs to develop appropriate policies and practices to address the issues regarding the adoption of new technologies, regarding both employees and customers. The transition to a new environment where data science plays a main role in the solving of social problems, can be benefitted from proactiveness in the matter of privacy problems that threaten the security of individuals. Companies need to be proactive in order to avoid being tricked and mistreated with possible inappropriate regulations made by governments, unions, or other parties.

*Identify the regulatory framework and institutions that affect the digital economy*

The regulations that have a direct impact on the development of the digital economy are notoriously related to the provision of insufficient resources that do not contribute to allowing people to have access to the internet. As mentioned in the report Digital technologies for a new future [9] the quality of connectivity in the countries affects opportunities for teleworking, and the average connectivity levels in most countries of the region are not good enough for high-consumption activities to be carried out simultaneously.
