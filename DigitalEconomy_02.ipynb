    "#### Describe the growth of the digital economy\n",
    "\n",
    "The first glance of what digital economy is in history was presented in the late 1980's with the internet allowing a massive connection of economies around the world. Certainly, this tendency of businesses and companies expanding towards a digitalized environment has significantly increased in recent years, with the development of new technologies and practices such as Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and cloud computing. It is important to notice how these changes have impacted social structures to the point where new regulations and economy models have emerged. Similarly, other aspects that are closely related to economy are being reshaped to satisfy the rising needs being some of the most relevant communication, interaction and consumption models [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describe the ICT (Information and communication technologies) Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of Information and Communication Technologies indicators is helping countries collect statistical information on this matter that can be reliable and comparable across nations. These include definitions of terms, model questions, calculation of indicators, collection scope, and classificatory variables, and have been modified and corrected in many years since their first agreement in 2005. They are commonly divided into six main categories which are: ICT Infrastructure and access, Access to, and use of, ICT by households and individuals, Use of ICT by businesses, The ICT producing sector, International trade in ICT goods, and Indicators on ICT in education [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identify and describe ICT-based business models\n",
    "\n",
    "The business models that were built to satisfy the needs of the new digital economy are significantly greater in scale and can reach a larger amount of places when compared to traditional ones. One popular model is e-commerce, whch described by the OECD can be seen as *the sale or purchase of goods or services, conducted over computer networks by methods specifically designed for the purpose of receiving or placing of orders*. This single model is too broad that comprises other specific types of practices such as business-to-costumers model, and consumer-to-consumer model. Another important business model apart from e-commerce is the one of payment services, which provide a large number of services like cash payment solutions, and e-wallets. Other examples of business models are app stores, online advertising, cloud computing, high-frequency trading, and participative networked platforms [3].  \n",

    "#### Explain strategic data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of strategic data allows us to realize in which context we find ourselves and what is the true outcome of the situation. This is considered a more in-depth concept compared to data analysis, as the person leading it has a deeper knowledge and understanding of the subject acquired from time of experience. The goal of this is to lay out a detailed plan to mature in analytical capabilities and transition from hindsight decision making to foresight decision making. That is, when you start digging into the data, we start to tackle a goal. And although there will be forks along the data path process, it is there that strategic vision allows us to maintain and understand the correct path; then it is possible to say that it is information and strategic knowledge that keeps us on the right track, putting the analytical method into practice. With this it is possible to obtain more specific and effective results. There are some elements considered relevant in the analysis of the data strategy, such as: Business requirements, Data supply and collection, Technological infrastructure requirements, Transformation of data into knowledge, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describe ICT patents\n",
    "\n",
    "Patents, standards and their combination are important in the information and communication technology sector, in particular in mobile communication. Patents are responsible for the public disclosure of a new method of operating any aspect of an economic company, such as: electronic commerce, banking, insurance, tax compliance, among others. It is significant to note that business productivity has grown significantly due to the main topic revolution. This is the representation of a multiple use of technologies to revolutionize communication throughout the world. It is important to mention that ICT companies regularly face complex problems related to corporate law and intellectual property rights. On the other hand, it must be considered Â´for the digital future that due to the importance of ICT, in order to solve patent problems a deep knowledge of technology is necessary. Patents protect technological inventions; this means that products or processes that provide new technological solutions to problems. An interesting fact is that this indicator can be used as a proxy for technological development in the ICT field. Last but not least, let us remember that ICT patents are mainly identified using International Patent Classification (IPC) codes and cover 13 areas such as the following: high-capacity information analysis, mobile communications, high-speed networks, computing high speed, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describe the impact in other areas: telecommunications, health, agriculture, science, energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has impact in many daily routine areas, but one of the most interesting and uncredible is the case of health, that means, the emerging role of ICT has created a huge impact on healthcare. ICT helps the management to improve the patient safety and satisfaction, get updated to the latest technology, have some knowledge on population health and statistics and keep a note on the government mandates on track. On the other hand, the complex ICTs used in agriculture production, such as traceability systems, tend to be concentrated in large operations with access to more sophisticated export markets. telecentres and computer supply and connectivity programs for rural schools have been the most extensive experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identify the historical stages of the development of technology.\n",
    "Of course, to speak of technology is to speak of the human being himself, and why not, of society as well, since technology is the use of knowledge for man to modify his environment for his benefit.\n",
    "Although it is normal for many authors to talk about the stages of technology referring to the industrial revolutions [1], it would be wrong not to consider the previous stages, which although they were not outstanding moments for technological innovation, they definitely needed human ingenuity to have a less harsh life.\n",
    "We could define the stages as follows:\n",
    "1.\tStone Age technology (to c. 3000 BCE)\n",
    "At this stage we are in the Paleolithic, in which humans, in addition to using stones and sticks with shapes that represented an advantage, began to manipulate these objects by hitting them with other objects, in order to obtain the shape they wanted. This is perhaps one of the oldest proofs of technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tFirst industrial revolution.\n",
    "The first industrial revolution meant the use of steam engines to increase the productivity of factories, although the work was not automated, it helped workers to perform their tasks faster. Similarly, coal influenced the operation of other devices and vehicles, with trains and railroads being the most representative examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tSecond industrial revolution.\n",
    "The era of the First World War saw an unprecedented change in technology, the use of materials such as gas and the introduction of electricity in manufacturing processes and in the daily life of citizens, combined with new means of transportation, allowed a great era of economic prosperity in the countries of the West.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tThird Industrial Revolution\n",
    "This era is characterized by the increased use of renewable energies, the use of intelligent electrical systems. It is at this stage when we can appreciate the first steps of automation. Mechatronics and intelligent circuits begin to form an important part of production systems. As expected, information technologies are also involved.\n",
    "5.\tForth Industrial Revolution\n",
    "This is where the largest global companies are located. It is more of an \"upgrade\" from the previous era. Technologies are now smarter, IT is a mandatory part of any company, processes can now be automated and even humans can be replaced by robots to do simple tasks. The use of clean energy is maintained, and renewable energy is the new trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identify the relevant indicators of the digital economy.\n",
    "When we talk about digital economy, of course we have to take into account the Information and Communication Technologies sector.\n",
    "The indicators of this new economy are usually the capital allocated to invest in technologies by companies. As mentioned above, the environment and its care are an essential part of this, which is why the use of clean and renewable energies is another important.\n",
    "Everything that has to do with ICT is considered important in this economy, as it serves as an indication of which countries are more technologically developed:\n",
    "ICT demand indicator.\n",
    "ICT Gross Domestic Product.\n",
    "ICT Imports.\n",
    "ICT exports.\n",
    "ICT private consumption.\n",
    "ICT private investment.\n",
    "ICT public consumption.\n",
    "Public ICT investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identify the impact of ICTs in other areas.\n",
    "The impact of Information and Communication Technologies has not only been present in industry and science, but also has a strong presence in other areas. Possibly one of the best examples is education. ICTs have allowed in some way to democratize information; we can see this in the courses that are offered online, universities that have online courses and classes. Entertainment is also a clear example, social networks and streaming platforms to enjoy music, videos and other multimedia content. Transportation systems also make use of this. It is more difficult to think of a sector that does not use ICTs. The same technology and progress has forced all business areas to join this revolution, otherwise, they are destined to fail.\n",
